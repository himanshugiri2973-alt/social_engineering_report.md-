Social Engineering Attacks Report
-------------------------------------
This repository contains my work for Task 5 of the Oasis Infobyte Cybersecurity Internship.
The focus of this task was to research different types of social engineering attacks and study how they affect organizations.

About the Task
----------------
Social engineering is one of the most common methods attackers use to trick people into revealing information or giving access.
For this task, I researched the main types of social engineering attacks, how they work, real examples, and the impact they can cause.

What’s Included
------------------

This report covers:

Types of social engineering attacks (phishing, pretexting, baiting, etc.)

Case studies of real incidents

Their impact on people and organizations

Prevention and recommendations

Why This Task Matters
----------------------
Social engineering attacks target human behavior instead of technical systems.
Understanding these attacks helps strengthen overall security because even strong systems can fail if people are not aware of the risks.
